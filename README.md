# Minimalist Radiance

Generates desktop backgrounds by blending random gradients with random masks. Simple and colourful. Generate one - or generate a million.

![Sample1](/samples/sample1.png?raw=true "Sample 1")

![Sample2](/samples/sample2.png?raw=true "Sample 2")

![Sample3](/samples/sample3.png?raw=true "Sample 3")

## Requirements

Requires the Python imaging library (PIL, or pillow). And requires numpy..? Originally I did not make this to share ;)

## Usage

This run with default settings generates 3 images, 1920x1080, in a folder called 'output'.

	python3 main.py

To see all options, run this command:

	python3 main.py -h
